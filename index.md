Hi and welcome to my homepage!

I am a Computer Scientist and Engineer.

I joined <a href="https://maticrobots.com/" target="_blank">Matic Robots</a> as a Research Engineer in June 2024, where we are building robots that save people time and energy.

I graduated from Cornell University with a Masters specializing in Large Language Model application in robotics at the <a href="https://portal-cornell.github.io/" target="_blank">PoRTaL group</a> and teaching amazing courses in several sub-fields of CS. I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2021.

I have worked at Samsung Electronics developing 5G vRAN software.
 
I find my interests in Artificial Intelligence for Language and Perception, Programming Languages and Learning Theory.

I have found that learning never stops, and teaching concepts I learn accelerates the process exponentially.
