Hi and welcome to my homepage!

I am a Computer Scientist by passion and Machine Learning Engineer by profession.

I joined <a href="https://neuralink.com/" target="_blank">Neuralink</a> in December 2025 to shape the research and application of Deep Learning in Brain Computer Interfaces.

Before this I was at <a href="https://maticrobots.com/" target="_blank">Matic Robots</a>, where a talented team is building robots that save people time and energy.

I graduated from Cornell University with a Masters applying in multimodal AI for robotic task planning at the <a href="https://portal-cornell.github.io/" target="_blank">PoRTaL group</a>, while teaching courses in several sub-fields of CS as a Teaching Assistant. I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2021, focusing on speech recognition research.

I have worked at Samsung Electronics developing 5G vRAN software.
 
I find my interests in Artificial Intelligence for Language and Perception, Programming Languages and Learning Theory.

I have found that learning never stops, and teaching concepts I learn accelerates the process exponentially.
